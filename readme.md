Hello!Nice to meet you

I'm Kyle from Taiwan. I graduated from Department of Computer Science and Engineering at National Chung Hsing University, specializing in natural language generation and large language models.

I enjoy learning new things, trying anything, and learning from the process. 
I am also a research assistant in the NLP lab and had an internship in Delta for two months, and currently searching for a job as a machine learning engineer!

Feel free to contact me if you have any further questions!
Have a nice day! Thank you
